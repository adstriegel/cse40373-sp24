# Schedule - ND CSE 40373 - Second Half - Spring 2024

Quick Links: [Canvas](https://canvas.nd.edu)

In the second half, we will transition over to a bit more hardware-centric as well as theoretical view.  The first half was largely about building awareness of the different types of things that enable us to interact with the physical / real-world, in the second half, we will be focusing on the course project and taking a look at how we make our devices robust and resilient as well as enabling different modalities of interactions.
