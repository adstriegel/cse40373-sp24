# Recap - Lecture 21

## Key Points

* What make real-time systems unique?
* Define the terms period and deadline.
* Compare / contrast: hard, firm, soft (see Lecture 22 for the correct notes)
* Why does determining schedule feasibility matter?
* What is RMS? What is the rough scheduling limit for RMS?

## Upcoming Lecture

We will continue looking at real-time scheduling exploring EDF and LLF as well as various advanced concepts with regards to real-time scheduling ((m,k), imprecise computing, power vs. schedulability, etc.).
