# Recap - Lecture 08

Slides for the lecture can be found on Canvas in the Files.

## Key Points

* For the Arduino UNO, what does a memory address look like? Why?
* What is Output Compare? How does it work?
* What is PWM?  Describe the different components as they related to PWM.  
* How does PWM typically operate? 
* What is the difference between PWM and how one controls a stepper motor?
* Does the microcontroller typically power a motor? Why or why not?
* What is a microstep?

## Next Lecture

We will switch away from digital input / output into analog input / output (A/Ds).
