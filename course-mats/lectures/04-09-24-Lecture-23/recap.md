# Recap - Lecture 23

## Key Points

* What is fault tolerance?
* Compare / contrast: fault, error, failure.
* What is reliability versus availability?
* Compare / contrast: MTTF, MTBF, MTTR.
* Compare / contrast the following types of faults: transient vs. persistent, malicious vs. benign, fail stop.
* What is the difference between safety versus liveness?
* Cmpare / contrast: masking, non-masking, fail-safe, graceful degradation.

## Upcoming Lecture

We will continue on with fault tolerance before transitioning into time sensitivity for networking and low power networking.
