# Recap - Lecture 05

## Not Covered

We will defer taking apart the V-Tech toys and Drone Home for Thursday.  We will also do a bit of live testing with the stopwatch.  

## Skills / Topics

* What is TTL? What is CMOS? What voltage levels do they have?
* What is a schematic? What is the mechanical drawing?
* Explain basic components of a data sheet.  
* Give examples of digital input.
* Give examples of digital output.
* What is V_IH? What is V_IL?
* Is it better to source or to sink current? How does that impact your design?

## Looking Ahead

In the next lecture, we will look at why the logical design can be complicated to translate to the physical layout on the actual Printed Circuit Board (PCB).  We will examine various parallel approaches (all bits, all at once) including the Centronics printer interface.
