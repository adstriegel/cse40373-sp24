# Recap - Lecture 03

## Not Covered

We deferred examining the V-Tech toys for disassembly.  We also only peripherally looked at the GPIO documentation.  

## Skills / Topics

* How does pointer math work?
* How do you test for a bit?
* How do you test for multiple bits?
* What is the difference between segmented versus flat memory mapping for devices?
* What is a control register (for a device)? Give examples.
* What is a status register (for a device)? Give examples.
* What is a data register (for a device)? Give examples.  
* Does a read to the same memory address as previously written in an embedded system always yield the same result?

## Next Up

* GPIO in more detail
* Disassembly / analysis
* Polling versus interrupts, device drivers, IRQ, XIRQ, PIC, exceptions, nested interrupts
