# Recap - Lecture 04

## Not Covered

While we did get a chance to examine the V-Tech toys, we did not get a chance to take them apart.  We will do that this next Tuesday or Thursday in class as is appropriate.  

## Skills / Topics

* What the difference between a polling versus an interrupt-driven approach?
* What is an exception?
* What is a vector table?
* How do you get a function pointer in C?
* What are the sequence of events that happen when an interrupt is raised?
* What is IRQ? XIRQ? PIC?
* What does it mean to have a nested interrupt?
* Are interrupts prioritizable?

## Next Up

* Datasheets - what does it mean to have a digital 1? digital 0? How do we read them?
* How do we identify the respective parts of a chip from the datasheet?
* How does a LED work?
* How does an input switch work? What mechanical aspects impact our input (bouncing)?
