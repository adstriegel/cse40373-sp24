# Recap - Lecture 24

## Key Points

* How does one typically drive a motor with a microcontroller (e.g. Pick a Lab)?
* How does the number of components generally impact reliability?
* What is TMR? What is the purpose of the voter?
* What is high availability (HA)? How is it different from TMR?
* What is hot versus a cold standby? What is the difference in terms of how it operates?
* What is a Byzantine fault? Why is it hard to detect?
* What is emergent behavior?
* What is the difference between Fault Avoidance vs. Fault Removal vs. Fault Tolerance?
* Give an example of the following types of redundancy: information, time, physical.
* How does fault tolerance impact SWaP-C?

## Upcoming Lecture

We will move into time exploring time synchronization, time sensitive networking, and eventually segue into low power networking.
