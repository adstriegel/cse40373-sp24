# Microcontrollers

If you want to purchase a microcontroller to work with, there are a few fairly good choices to tinker / experiment with.  It is not required to buy one for the class but if you are interested in tinkering outside of the class, here are a few recommendations.  Typically, a fully capable setup will run you on the order of $50-$80 with some of the kits topping out over $100.  

While things have gotten considerably better and the chips themselves can be quite cheap, a board for the purposes of evaluation still is rarely in the sub-$50 range.  

* **Raspberry Pi 3, 4, or 5:** Unless you have a specific need for faster WiFi or Ethernet, either of the respective versions of the Raspberry Pi will work just fine.  One twist is that there was a shift with the Raspberry Pi 4 to a micro-HDMI connector which requires an adapter.  We do have cables / etc. down in the lab that you can use / borrow to get things rolling (e.g. micro HDMI).

* **Raspberry Pi Zero:** I have a couple of the Pi Zero W 2 boards that are recently ordered.  Generally, these are a slimmer form factor version of the Pi.  For the purpose of this class, you would be good either way.  

* **Arduino:** The Arduino is a fantastic choice for a more limited / battery power microcontroller.  Many 3D printers rely on the Arduino including the ones offered by Lulzbot, one of which I have in my office (modded TAZ 4).  

## Online Locations

Unfortunately, there are not a lot of great local locations to pick these items up.  Generally, steering clear of Amazon is recommended due to the amount of junk / offerings of questionable reliability for the core processor / kit.  

For many parts that end up being a one time use, we often have them and can share them as needed for that action, e.g. first boot of a Raspberry Pi.  

* [Canakit](https://www.canakit.com): Canakit is a fairly reasonable vendor that typically has kits in stock.  
* [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com): Sparkfun is a great site / resource for various kits and add-on boards.
* [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com): Also a great hobbyist site for ordering up devices and add-ons / kits.
* [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com): Fairly large site for ordering up chips in bulk.  Cheaper but also a bit more difficult to browse.
* [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com): Same as Mouser, large on-line site usually used for bulk orders.
