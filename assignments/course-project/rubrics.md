# Rubrics - Course Project

There are three deliverables associated with the course project that include:

* Demonstration Video - [Rubric](https://github.com/adstriegel/cse40373-sp24/blob/main/assignments/course-project/Rubric-Video.pdf)
   * The demonstration video is due at the start of class and will be played in class in Fitzpatrick B19B.  You may use the same mechanism that you did for sharing for Status Report 1 and Status Report 2.
* Written Report - [Rubric](https://github.com/adstriegel/cse40373-sp24/blob/main/assignments/course-project/Rubric-Report.pdf)
   * A written report that accompanies your code as submitted that evening.  The written report will likely be on the order of five or more pages and should contain a title page, executive summary (abstract), solution overview, and a detailed discussion of the features, architecture, and schematic as well as a build of materials for the project.  
* Final Code - [Rubric](https://github.com/adstriegel/cse40373-sp24/blob/main/assignments/course-project/Rubric-Code.pdf)
   * The code should be fully checked in via GitHub and shared used the same mechanisms as with the Status Report.    

## Demonstration Video

[Rubric](https://github.com/adstriegel/cse40373-sp24/blob/main/assignments/course-project/Rubric-Video.pdf)

The video is meant to be an ideal demonstration of your course project demonstrating the full set of features that you have operational. For an overview of the video, see the slide deck from Lecture 26 or the accompanying Panopto recording.  The video format allows you to appropriately prioritize demonstration of key features without the issues potentially associated with a live demonstration.  

### Video Guidelines (from the slides)

* 5-7 minutes long
* Group member info / introduction
* Project Overview
   * What are you trying to do?
* Schematic / Architecture
   * How does your system work?
* Demo
   * Show the system working

Optionally, you may also do a live demo.  There will be time for live demos briefly at the end of your video.  

## Final Report

[Rubric](https://github.com/adstriegel/cse40373-sp24/blob/main/assignments/course-project/Rubric-Report.pdf)

The final report should fully describe the details associated with your course project.  It should include the materials as noted below:

* Title Page
   * Project Name
   * Group Members and Contact Information (e-mail)
   * Executive Summary / Abstract
* Project Overview
   * A brief overview and motivation for the project 
* Solution
   * Figures including the overall architecture and wiring schematics
      * Note that the schematics may be drawn as appropriate in PowerPoint or other tools.  An official schematic is not required but a picture of final solution is not sufficient. 
   * Written description of how the project operates describe general sequence of events and operation
   * Identification of key features as delivered by the course project 
   * Build of Materials (BoM)
      * A complete listing of the build of materials for the solution as demonstrated including identifying all parts as well as a cost for each part as known
* Next Steps
   * If you were to have an additional month, what features could be delivered in the short term or what would be the next steps for someone to continue working on the project

## Final Code

[Rubric](https://github.com/adstriegel/cse40373-sp24/blob/main/assignments/course-project/Rubric-Code.pdf)

A final submission of the code for the course project should be shared via a GitHub link.  The code should be well-structured, well-commented, and should include an appropriate README.md.

It is not necessary to include the demonstration video nor the Final Report in the repository though you may choose to use the GitHub repository and Markdown for your final report as you see fit.
